# Abstract

The web is becoming a very interesting platform for creative experimentation.
The introduction of the WebMIDIAPI and the capabilities of the WebAudioAPI for
creating sounds has opened the doors for musical expressions in a myriad of
ways.

One such way is to build a simple polyphonic supersaw synthesizer which you can
control with a MIDI-enabled interface (such as a tiny keyboard). This is easier
than it sounds, and I will show you how. Leaving this talk you will be equipped
tostart creating music and explore the creative side of the web.
